Travel time estimation (TTE) task is indispensable in mobile navigation, route planning and other applications in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Although existing works can obtain good results on their datasets, the generalization ability and fine-grained route-feature learning ability still lack. We hereby propose a meta-learning based model to provide accurate travel time estimations for multi-city scenarios using single model.
