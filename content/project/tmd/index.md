Transportation mode detection, as a significant branch of human activity recognition (HAR), is of great importance in analyzing human travel patterns, traffic prediction and planning. Though many works have been devoted to transportation mode detection, there remains challenge for accurate and robust transportation pattern identification. We hereby propose a scalable deep learning framework to provide accurate detection results for transportation mode. Moreover, we investigate the possibility to utilize image data extracted from raw sensor data to construct virtual nodes for transportation graph to provide accurate estimation results.
