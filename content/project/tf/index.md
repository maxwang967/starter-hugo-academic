Traffic forecasting is a key problem in intelligent transportation system. Specailly, we focus on the accurate travel speed forecasting based on METR-LA and PEMS datasets, which contains both spatial (graph based) and temporal sensor data. Considering the complex feature representations for daily traffic scenarios, we utilize attention-based methods to model the temporal features and utilize graph-based networks to model the spatial features. Learning multi-range features is also considered in our research work.
