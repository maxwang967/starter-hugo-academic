bio: I work on machine learning and deep learning methods for intelligent
  transportation systems. I’m generally interested in travel time estimation,
  traffic flow prediction based on spatio-temporal data and methods and
  transportation mode detection. Specially, I'm mainly focusing on data mining
  techniques for time series data and non-Euclidean structure data (e.g.
  attention-based methods or graph neural networks etc.).
interests:
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Spatio-temporal Data Mining
  - Flutter, Android and Django

I'm currently pursing P.h.D in Beijing University of Posts and Telecomunications working as a research assistant in the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I'm also serving as Reviewer in IEEE Network Magazine, Software Tech Lead in DYZN, as well as Adviser in HBY and Path Academics.
